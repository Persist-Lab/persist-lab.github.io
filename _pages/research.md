We are a dynamic research group at the [Department of Computer Science at Dartmouth College](https://web.cs.dartmouth.edu/). Our aim is to explore and develop novel information extraction and fusion techniques using applied machine learning with applications in smart health, personalized assistant, and intelligent environments.

### Gene discovery in autism spectrum disorder and other developmental disorders
<div style="text-align: justify">
Exome sequencing has revolutionized our ability to find the genes associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other severe developmental disorders. Four papers, published concurrently in 2012, showed an excess of de novo mutations that disrupt genes in cases compared to controls and Dr. Sanders, working in Dr. State's lab at Yale, was the first author of one of these. This paper also demonstrated that observing disruptive de novo mutations in the same gene across multiple cases could be used to establish genome-wide association with ASD, and this method was used to identify the voltage-gated sodium channel SCN2A as one of the most frequent causes of ASD.

### Understanding the role of ASD genes
<div style="text-align: justify">
The genes discovered through exome sequencing provide an entree into the biology of ASD, hopefully as a foundation for developing theraputics. The Sanders Lab takes two research approaches: 1) To consider ASD-associated genes en masse to look for patterns of convergence [State MW, Å estan N Science 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22984058); 2) To investigate the genes with the strongest evidence of ASD association, such as SCN2A in depth.
