Sarah M. Preum is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Dartmouth College and Director of the Pervasive Intelligent Systems Lab (PersistLab). She also serves as the Technical Associate Director at the Dartmouth Center for Precision Health and Artificial Intelligence. Her research lies at the intersection of natural language processing, human–AI interaction, and computational health. She designs, develops and evaluate socio-technical AI systems that improve communication, coordination, and well-being in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. 
Sarah has authored over 55 peer-reviewed papers in leading CS venues, including <b>AAAI, ACL, EMNLP, ICWSM, CHI, IMWUT, JMIR, ICDE, PerCom,</b> and <b>ACM Computing Surveys</b>. Her research has been supported by the NIH, Google Research, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NSF, and multiple institutional grants. She also serves as an Associate Editor for <b>ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare</b>.
</br>
</br>
Before joining Dartmouth, Sarah was a Postdoctoral Research Scholar at Carnegie Mellon University’s School of Computer Science. She earned her Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Virginia in 2020. Her doctoral and postdoctoral work on cognitive assistance and context-aware AI received numerous recognitions, including <b>Rising Stars in EECS</b> (2020), the UVA Graduate Commonwealth Fellowship, the Adobe Research Scholarship, the NSF Smart and Connected Health Student Award, and the UVA Big Data Fellowship.
Sarah’s research and mentoring are guided by the belief that intelligent systems should empower rather than replace human expertise. Her work aims to advance technologies that strengthen communication, build trust, and improve health outcomes across diverse populations in the U.S. and the Global South.
